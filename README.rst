About
-----
Scripts to prepare the HTML5Boilerplate for Django usage.

Usage
-----
* Download HTML5Boilerplate (currently supported: 1.0, documented (other versions may work, too))
* Extract it into this directory (should give you a 'paulirish-html5-boilerplate-something dir)
* execute 'make'

TODO
----
(what currently has to be done manually and/or to be documented)
* separate templates from static files in folders
* point settings.py to these folders
* path adjustments in config of buildscript

Contributions
-------------
* The boilerplate.convert.sed file is copied (currently unmodified) from this repository:
  https://github.com/slafs/django-html5-boilerplate
